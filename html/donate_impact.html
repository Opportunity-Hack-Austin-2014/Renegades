              Working in Mae Sot was the most rewarding experience of my life. I have learnt a lot and acquired many precious relationships that I will cherish for rest of my life.

              Connecther has never failed to motivate me regarding helping others and finding ways to help them. When I was thinking of different ways to 

              raise funds for a girl who dreamt of attending Hague Symposium to know more about peace and security, 

              Connecther was the one who said, don't worry we will help you to raise that money.

              Thank you for giving me the opportunity to help others and making my life so meaningful.

              Although I didn't anticipate this beforehand, making this film and being a part of the film competition has been such a perfect opportunity for me to voice my thoughts and emotions, and it has actually been quite therapeutic. I am so happy to have been a part of the film competition this year, and I would absolutely love to be part of it next year in any way that I can.

              I thought that this year was really amazing, superb, fantastic, and all of the other synonyms that fall in that category. Last year was great too, but I think that this was a big step up from last year. (Maybe it is because I was laughing so much at everything Ian said). It was a great mix of serious and comical, which kept the event very engaging. 

              Thanks again,

              Jordyn
